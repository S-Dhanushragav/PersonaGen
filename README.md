# PersonaGen: AI-Powered Visual Identity Generator (ComfyUI + LoRA)

**PersonaGen** is a Generative AI project built using **ComfyUI** that enables stylized image generation powered by LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models. The system is designed to create character-based visual outputs based on text prompts with style transfer features.

# PersonaGen: AI-Powered Visual Identity Generator (Ongoing Project)

## Summary
PersonaGen is a generative AI project focused on creating personalized stylized images using facial data. It leverages ComfyUI workflows and LoRA training to develop lightweight visual identity models.

## Objectives
- Build and train LoRA models on curated human face datasets
- Use ComfyUI to design, visualize, and modify workflows
- Generate stylized visuals (cartoon, cyberpunk, manga, etc.)
- Deploy ComfyUI workflows for backend image adaptation tasks

## ðŸ› Tools & Stack
- Python 3.10+
- ComfyUI (local setup on CPU)
- PyTorch (CPU build)
- Dataset: 16 individual faces, 260 images, 512x512 size
- LoRA Training (node setup in progress)

## Current Progress
- ðŸ§ª Workflow experiments ongoing
